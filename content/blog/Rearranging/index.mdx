title: How to Re-assemble a Productive Life

This is my attempt to post a new entry on a blog of my own creation.

This is a multipurpose effort *for myself* to re-evaluate and assess where I stand,
where I can direct my effort, and where I should direct my effort.  

We (Russ and Chloe Johnston) relocated from Chicago to Dayton in April.  We were driven by a variety of factors,
but mostly the uncertainty/risk in the City of Chicago coupled with the lack of perceived benefit of being "locked up" in
our apartment relative to the possible benefits (neither of us was going into an office and couldn't credibly try to
see our friends.)

We were lucky to be able to stay with my parents for three months, but did not develop a coherent routine.
In July, we were ready to move on, with some degree of clarity of purpose of what *could* come next.

Many bad things have happened over the course of 2020 for many (including the death of my Aunt, Linda).  However,
Chloe and I also were blessed to finally have the opportunity to become pregnant with a child growing in her as I write this.

If all goes according to plan, we will have a daughter in April 2021.  What a strange world she will be entering.

Much seems in doubt, particularly as I write this on the eve of a national election which seems more charged and salient.
Oddly enough, Chloe, in her new job just got off a business development call with a client/prospect where 
~15 minutes of a 30 minute call were consumed with discussing the possible outcome of the Presidential election.

I'm happy to put down my view that it's most likely that Donald Trump will *not* be re-elected, but I 
am more than willing to acknowledge that I understand how probabilities work and a 10% chance happens once out of ten times.

Sometimes when you need a D20 roll, you get it.  (And Trump doesn't even need that).

Rather than continue to political digression, I should call out that I don't think much will change for **most**,
following the election. (And I won't get into the speculative rabbit hole of widespread social unrest.)

To return to purpose the purpose of this *specific* blog: an experimental zone to play with web development.

The broader purpose is to compose my thoughts about what I ought to be doing so I am proud of the life I am living.

There are many areas of my life which are "off the tracks," which I intend to right.

I will expand upon each of the following categories in time, but The areas I can set life in a more orderly fashion are:

1. Purpose / Objective
1. Family Orientation
1. Physical Fitness
1. Mental Fitness
1. Fiscal / financial Fitness
1. Meta-process tracking and feedback integration

This is will be subject to change and revision, but I believe it captures the majority of areas where I seek to improve myself.
I am not a blank slate, but each day is a fresh start by which to move further in the direction of a life I hope to be proud of, or further away.

Each of us only has one life.  I am not so egotistical as to desire to outlive my body through others' memory across generations.

I believe such an accomplishment is only probable for fanatics of a sort.  My objective shall be to strive to live up to my expectations
and ability.  Wherever possible, balancing the considerations of each of the categories above.  

Inevitably, I will fail.  Failure, however, should not foreclose attempts.  We will all fail, in the end.
